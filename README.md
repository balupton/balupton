[I'm an old-school open-sourcer](https://balupton.com) who doesn't get paid to do open-source outside of the donations that I receive from people like you and companies like yours. I'm building my non-profit [Bevry](https://bevry.me) out of my own wallet and working each day to making it sustainable via donations and eventually larger open-source apps and services too.

My open-source work gets *half a billion installs each month* and are used by every big company — probably on your machine right now — yet all that I get back is what's here from the few awesome sponsors like you.

If I have saved you time as a user or saved you money as a company, then sponsoring affords me the time to add more value back to you.
