I'm building my boostrapped non-profit [Bevry](https://github.com/bevry), working each day to sustainability via donations and eventually open-source services.

My open-source software gets *half a billion installs each month* and is used by every big company, probably on your machine right now!

Sponsorhip funds me, so I can add more more value to you and the commons.

🙇‍♂️ Fund using [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/balupton) and [alternatives.](https://bevry.me/fund)
