I'm building my non-profit [Bevry](https://github.com/bevry) out of my own wallet and working each day to making it sustainable via donations and eventually larger open-source apps and services.

My open-source work gets *half a billion installs each month* and are used by every big company — probably on your machine right now.

Sponsorhip ensures I don't starve and can continue contributing more time and value to you.
